# AI3D-Project 8: Digitalizing Real-Life Objects with State-of-the-Art 3D Reconstruction Methods
> Theme: 3D Reconstruction from Real-World Images
## Project Description:
This project aims to evaluate the performance of cutting-edge 3D reconstruction models when applied to real-life images captured using standard mobile phones. While recent advancements in 3D reconstruction have demonstrated impressive results using synthetic or controlled datasets, their effectiveness on real-world, casually captured images remains to be thoroughly assessed. By capturing images of everyday objects and processing them through various state-of-the-art models, this project seeks to compare their capabilities in terms of geometry accuracy, texture fidelity, and overall reconstruction quality.
